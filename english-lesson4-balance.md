is obligation the other side of right?

Yes, obligation can be considered as the other side of right. In the context of rights and obligations, rights refer to the entitlements or freedoms that individuals possess, while obligations refer to the corresponding responsibilities or duties that individuals have towards others or society. Rights and obligations are often seen as interconnected and mutually dependent. For example, if someone has the right to freedom of speech, others have the obligation to respect that right and not infringe upon it. Similarly, if individuals have the right to a fair trial, the government has the obligation to provide a fair and impartial judicial system. Thus, rights and obligations are closely linked and form the basis of a balanced and functioning society.
