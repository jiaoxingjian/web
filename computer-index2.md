28 common computer science terms
Review some of the most frequently used terms to expand your computer science knowledge:

1. Analog
Analog technology relies on methods other than number processing to perform a function. Examples of analog devices include tape recorders and cameras that record on film. While analog is outdated and not as frequently used, it's useful for computer scientists to understand all methods of creating technology.

2. Application
An application, often shortened to app, is a series of codes that allow specific tasks to happen. Applications can be on mobile devices, desktop computers and other electronic devices. An example of an application is an operating system that allows an electronic device to run programs like word processing software and respond to commands, like opening or closing files.

3. Array
Array refers to a set of similar data that saves in a sequential form. When a computer program searches for certain information, it can pull up an array, which includes any similar data that might be useful. For example, a search for monthly social media reports can produce an array of relevant files that are organized alphabetically or numerically.

4. Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the amount of information that hard-wired or wireless connections can process or transmit. An internet service provider may refer to the bandwidth when advertising its download and upload speeds. The amount of processed or transmitted information often depends on the connection format.

5. Binary digit (or bit)
A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest information piece a computer can use. A bit is either a one or a zero, as these two digits make up the language computers use to process information and operate. One byte is equivalent to eight bits, and a kilobyte is equivalent to 1,024 bytes. Additional measurements include the megabyte, which is 1,024 kilobytes, and the gigabyte, which is 1,024 megabytes.

6. BIOS
This abbreviation stands for basic input/output system. It's a platform that allows a computer to operate software found on a hard disk drive. When a computer turns on, it relies on the BIOS to operate.

7. Boolean
Boolean refers to a text or arithmetic expression with true or false value. The term most often appears as the phrase Boolean logic, which is an algebraic form that only includes values of true or false. Boolean logic helps test the conditions around the basis of iteration and selection. Some search engines use Boolean logic to filter out false results that don't match the search terms or criteria.

8. Buffer
Buffer is the location for storage of temporary data, often used in a device's random-access memory. By maintaining some temporary data, the device can perform an operation faster and more effectively. When a device has too much temporary data stored, it may operate more slowly.

9. Bug
A bug is an error in the programming of software or an application. These errors can cause problems for the end user. When looking for and resolving bugs, computer scientists and developers might refer to the process as fixing bugs or applying fixes.

10. Cloud storage
The cloud refers to a remote storage facility available anywhere on the internet. When storing files or data in the cloud, a user can access that information on any device. Cloud storage differs from traditional storage methods, which save data on a single physical device.

11. Code
Code is another term for the programming languages used to edit, create and manage computer applications and programs. Experienced developers and computer scientists often learn multiple coding languages, as each has its own uses and applications. Some of the most commonly used languages include object-oriented languages and procedural programming languages.

12. CGI
CGI is an abbreviation for common gateway interface. The term defines how a web server and auxiliary program can communicate with one another. This communication is important when a software user tries to use a program that relies on an internet connection, such as an online video game.

13. Client
A client is a program that requests information from other programs or processes. A computer can run multiple clients at once. For example, an email management system is a client that requests information from the email server to provide access to new messages and other data.

14. Control panel
A control panel allows for the changing of the settings, appearance and behavior of a program. It's the primary location of information about the program and how it behaves. The control panel allows for easy access to critical aspects of a program or app.

15. Debugging
Debugging, or debug, is a process that aims to find and remove bugs from the source code of a program. Computer programmers use debugging to get rid of issues before the end user experiences any problems using a program. This process might occur during the quality assurance phase of software development.

16. DOS
DOS is an acronym that means "disc operating system." It's an operating system that allows users to enter commands line by line to get the computer to open programs or respond in various ways. DOS isn't as commonly used in modern devices, but it was once the main operating system for all computers.

17. Disk storage
Disk storage is the opposite of cloud storage. It's the storage available on a hard drive or a device's long-term memory system. When the disk storage gets too full, a device may become less responsive or have trouble opening and running certain programs. This is because the device must process a lot of data to find and operate programs and apps.

18. Environment
The environment refers to the way all device factors interact with one another. These factors can include hardware, software and network protocols. Within the environment, each component can communicate with the others.

19. Ethernet
An Ethernet is a system that connects devices and computers to a shared network. This system supports monitored, efficient data transmission. Organizations often use it to restrict network access to authorized users and improve data security.

20. FAT
Short for file allocation table, the FAT resembles a table of contents for all the files on a computer. It exists to allow for easier access and location of files on the device. When searching for a file, a user might open the FAT to locate it.

21. IDE
IDE stands for integrated development environment. It's a programming system that includes multiple programming tools. These tools can include source code editing, debugging and syntax highlighting. Using the IDE can deliver a more integrated platform for developers to use.

22. Kernel
Kernel is a computer program that supports the main system on a computer when it starts up. The program allocates resources to various applications and establishes communication within the system. Kernel helps manage hardware and system needs.

23. LAN
LAN stands for local area network. The term refers to a computer network that spans a small physical area. To accommodate additional devices, computer scientists might connect several LANs.

24. Packet
A packet is a section that divides computer data or messages. Multiple packets might include the data of a single file. This division allows information to be transferred over a network more efficiently.

25. Pixel
The term "pixel" combines two words, "picture" and "element." It refers to a single point within a digital image. The higher the number of pixels in an image, the larger the file is and the better its image quality is.

26. Port
A port is a physical component that allows two devices to share data over a wired connection. Two common examples of connecting ports are High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and Universal Serial Bus (USB). A computer or mobile device might have multiple ports for various connection types.

27. Protocol
Protocol refers to the rules followed by two devices when they interact. The devices must share the same protocol to connect efficiently. Protocols can change, depending on the device and its unique rules.

28. TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for transmission control protocol/internet protocol. This term refers to the suite of protocols that connect computers on the internet. TCPs allow applications and devices to communicate, while IPs enable devices to share data. Computer scientists can adjust the protocols that connect host computers based on their unique needs.

## think
  videos like "build a 8bit computer" teaches the basic components of computer hardware.
  bios should be the base for a os. bios manage and configure the hardware subsystem like audio or video chips,and how they interact. like video module self registration. bios这层让各个硬件基本上能连上， 能工作。
  操作系统本质上定义了各种文件格式，发掘和定义了cpu的各种高级特性， 对下，**统一**了各个硬件的工作方式，定义了之间的交互的标准，对上，提供了系统api给应用程序调用。
