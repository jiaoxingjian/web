"Ask about attitude without asking about facts, ask about motives without asking about right or wrong, ask about closeness without asking about reasoning, ask about alignment without asking about justice, ask about position without asking about correctness."

This phrase highlights the importance of considering not only someone's attitude, motives, closeness, alignment, and position but also the underlying facts, right or wrong, reasoning, justice, and correctness in order to have a comprehensive understanding of a situation or issue.

if a person intentionally mix things up , so that other can not tell the right from the wrong, how should describe the situation.

The situation you are describing can be referred to as intentionally creating confusion or intentionally causing ambiguity. This can make it difficult for others to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong or to make clear judgments or decisions. It may also be seen as a form of manipulation or deception.


if a person want to change this kind of situation, how should i describe the situation?

If a person wants to change or address this kind of situation where intentional confusion or ambiguity is being created, it can be described as a need for clarity, transparency, or resolution(可以描述为对于清晰度、透明度或解决方案的需求。). The person may seek to establish clear guidelines, rules, or communication channels to ensure that there is no intentional mixing up or obfuscation of information(该人可能会寻求建立清晰的准则、规则或沟通渠道，以确保没有故意混淆或模糊信息的情况发生。). They may also aim to promote open and honest dialogue, encourage accountability and responsibility, and foster an environment of trust and fairness.



In this situation, propaganda can be assessed as a potential factor contributing to intentional confusion or ambiguity. Propaganda refers to the dissemination of information or ideas, often with a biased or misleading nature, to influence public opinion or promote a particular agenda. If someone is intentionally mixing things up to create confusion, they may be using propaganda techniques to manipulate or deceive others.
这种情况下，对于宣传的评估可以被视为造成故意混淆或模糊的一个潜在因素。宣传是指散播信息或观点，通常具有偏见或误导性质，以影响公众舆论或推动特定议程。如果有人故意混淆事物以制造困惑，他们可能使用宣传手段来操纵或欺骗他人。

Assessing propaganda involves critically examining the information being presented, considering the motives behind it, and evaluating its accuracy, fairness, and objectivity. It is important to analyze the sources of information, fact-check claims, and be aware of any potential biases or hidden agendas.
评估宣传涉及对所呈现的信息进行批判性分析，考虑背后的动机，并评估其准确性、公正性和客观性。重要的是要分析信息的来源，核实声明的真实性，并意识到潜在的偏见或隐藏议程。

To address propaganda, it is essential to promote media literacy and critical thinking skills. Encouraging individuals to question information, seek multiple perspectives, and verify facts can help counteract the effects of propaganda. Additionally, fostering an environment of open dialogue, respectful debate, and access to diverse sources of information can help individuals make informed decisions and reduce the impact of propaganda.

为了应对宣传，促进媒体素养和批判性思维技能至关重要。鼓励个体质疑信息，寻求多个角度，并验证事实，有助于应对宣传的影响。此外，营造开放对话、尊重辩论和获取多样化信息来源的环境，有助于个体做出明智决策，减少宣传的影响。

请注意，由于中文表达的灵活性和多义性，翻译结果可能会因语境而有所不同。

"路线，方针，政策" translates to "route, guidelines, policies" in English.
